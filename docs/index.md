# Research Interests
I am particularly interested in three closely related topics---visual abstract reasoning, analogy making, 
and mental imagery. And most of my works lie in the interdisciplinary area of AI and cognitive systems.

## Visual Abstract Reasoning
Visual abstract reasoning tasks are commonly used in human intelligence tests 
for they can be very insensitive to non-intelligence factors, such as cultural and educational background, 
and meanwhile, closely correlated to core intelligence factors, such as fluid intelligence. 
I build AI systems to solve visual abstract reasoning tasks. 
The interesting part of this work is not solving the problem per se,
but to build AI's ability of visual abstract reasoning that allows it to make sense out of unseen situations. 
In fact, the world "reasoning" here is a bit misleading when visual abstract reasoning is discussed,
because visual abstract reasoning tasks are mainly testing the ability to discover underlying patterns beneath the perceptual stimuli;
but once the underlying patterns are found, the reasoning is relatively trivial.

## Visual Analogy Making
Analogy making is at the center of human cognition. 
Like visual abstract reasoning, analogy problems are also widely used in many standardized tests.
Visual analogy making can be considered as a specific case of visual abstract reasoning,
in which reasoning is based on analogy. 
The interesting part of visual analogy making is, given two objects between which an analogy can be made,
when/how we process inter-object relations and when/how we process intra-object relations, 
i.e., relations between components in each object.
These two aspects of information processing are against and interdependent on each other.
It is similar to the question of "which came first: the chicken or the egg".
An iterative dynamic, possibly attention-based, cognitive process probably exists to reconcile between these two aspects.
And I am looking into possible implementations of such a cognitive process in AI systems.

## Computational Imagery
While the imagery debate for human cognition has been going on for decades and never got resolved, 
the imagery representation is an ideal way to realize AI and has been less explored in AI research.
AI (researchers) always has to face a trade-off between different representations; 
choosing one against another usually means an AI system that works in some situations but not the others.
In contrast, no matter what representation (imagery or proposition) human cognition uses,
it leads to robust intellectual ability in all situations.
I thus look into the possible implementations of mental imagery.
The interesting (and tricky)  part of this research is that mental imagery is not equivalent to mental images; 
and similarly, computational imagery is not equivalent to computer images.
In particular, human can experience the mental imagery when the corresponding perceptual input is absent;
human can mentally manipulate mental imagery and perform their thinking and reasoning through mental imagery, 
i.e., every step of the thinking process is rendered as a mental image;
and thus the abstract concepts can be easily obtained from mental imagery.
In a word, mental imagery implies visual thinking.

There are already some extremely prototypical AI systems that use mental imagery, 
for example, the generative deep learning models.
The ability to generate image according to latent variables is essential for mental imagery,
which is similar to the situation that human can experience mental imagery without perceptual input.
However, human mental imagery is far more sophisticated than generating images. 
These works can be a good start to explore the realm of computational imagery.

## The Paradoxical Flavor of My Research
As you can tell these research topics, they are all dealing with some paradoxical cases. 
For example, ...
While AI itself is paradoxical ... (GEB stuff), Gedol theorem
